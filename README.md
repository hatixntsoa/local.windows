# Local Windows Account Trick

From the OOBE Screen press Shift + F10

```
curl -L bypass.hatixntsoa.site -o bypass.cmd
bypass.cmd
```

This will skip the entire OOBE process including microsoft account and ANY questions during the setup process. It still allows you to select your language, region, and keyboard layout.
